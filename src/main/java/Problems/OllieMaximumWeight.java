Problem: Ollie is new to the gym and is figuring out the maximum weights she can lift.
The maximum capacity of the barbell is given as maxCapacity.
Each barbell plate has a weight, given by weights[i].
Now Ollie has to select as many plates as she can but the total weight
of the selected plates should not exceed maxCapacity.
What is the maximum weight of plates Ollie can add to the barbell?
For example, given barbell plates of weights of 1, 3 and 5 lbs and a
barbell of maximum capacity 7 lbs â€” the right plates to insert
would be 1 and 5 lbs (1+5 = 6), thus making the right answer 6.
