        WeakHashMap_ is an implementation of the Map interface.
        WeakHashMap_ is almost same as HashMap except in case of WeakHashMap_,
        if object is specified as key doesnâ€™t contain any references- it is eligible for garbage collection
        even though it is associated with WeakHashMap_. i.e Garbage Collector dominates over WeakHashMap_.

        Clone method Implementation: HashMap implements Cloneable interface.
        WeakHashMap does not implement Cloneable interface, it only implements Map interface.
        Hence, there is no clone() method in the WeakHashMap class.
