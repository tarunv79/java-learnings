 WeakHashMap - keys which are not referenced then both key-value are garbage collected
 HashMap is not synchronized and hence is not thread safe and is faster. It can have one null key
 HashTable is synchronized so is thread safe and slower. It cannot have null key.
  LinkedHashMap maintains insertion order
  TreeHashMap has all elements sorted
  List allows duplicates while set doesn't.  List also maintains insertion order while set doesn't, set keeps elements sorted
  LinkedHashSet retains insertion order
